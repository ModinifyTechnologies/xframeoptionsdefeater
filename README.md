A firefox extension, which allows iframes to ignore the x-frame-options header.

I use this to allow iframes to exist within my website, where they would otherwise fail.
For example, my [searchbar](http://nickthecoder.co.uk/searchbar/s.py) uses iframes,
but some of the search engines refuse to work within an iframe (including google).

With this extension, I can override this behaviour, so google (and others) now work within an iframe.
